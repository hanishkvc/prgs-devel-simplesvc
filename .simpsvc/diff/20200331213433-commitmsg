Add cur second to timestamp

Sometimes if one does say init and add or add and commit back to
back within a minute, then both the commit messages will have the
same timestamp. And this will lead to sorting of log problematic.

So now even second is also added as part of timestamp. So from a
normal human perspective such issue can no longer occur.

NOTE: In future if computers are lot lot more faster and or commit
things to a ram based disk, then maybe if commands are run from
a script, there could be a issue. A remote possibility which is
currently ignored.

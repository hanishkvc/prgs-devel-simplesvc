Implemented dprint, fixed issue with sort_diffDir

Had forgotten to return the sorted list from sort_diffDir
function. It has been fixed now.

Also implemented the dprint logic, which prints the msg
passed to it, only if the debug_level specified for the
message is smaller than the system's debug_level (which
is specified at the begining of the program).

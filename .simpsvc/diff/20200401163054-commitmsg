Commit only files specified (using add) after last commit

_cp updated to return exit status of os cp command

ssvc_cp updated to 

* take the BaseSrcPath also. Bcas we will be copying between ssvc
  directories like from workingDir (".") to cacheDir or from 
  cacheDir to copyDir

  Thus to the ssvc_... helper commands, we always provide the file
  involved as its tracked file info. And inturn specify any of the
  ssvc directories that logic may require to work with

* return if the cp was successful or not, as a boolean

* do_add updated to use this new copy logic by passing workingDir as
  the sBaseSrcPath, bcas add copies file from workingDir to cacheDir

_do_diff renamed to _do_difffile, so that the name represents its logic
of diffing a given file, clearly.

do_diff now allows its caller to explicitly specify the list of files
to work with.

* previously it was hardcoded to cross check all tracked files. 

* However given that now we have a 2-step commit flow consisting of

  * first adding files that need to be commited to the cacheDir over
    multiple calls to add command.

  * And inturn followed by calling commit command to commit only the
    files in the cacheDir.

* we may either want to go through the full tracked files list or only
  a subset which corresponds to those added to the cacheDir after last
  commit. And this helps achieve that.

* if the file list is not explicitly specified, then the logic reverts
  to the old behavior of going throu all the tracked files.

_commit_filediff updated to take the new file as the one in cacheDir and
not the one in workingDir.

_commit_filecopy updated to copy file from cacheDir to copyDir, using the
new ssvc_cp logic. Inturn if the copy is successful, then remove the file
from the cacheDir.

_commit_fileexists_list given a list of files (usually the tracked files), 
it checks if any of them has been added to the cacheDir, and inturn return 
the list of files, which exist in the cacheDir, for the given input file
list.

do_commit updated to

* use the new _commit_fileexists_list to get the list of files in cacheDir
  to work with, instead of the previous simpler map+filter logic.

  This was required bcas, the previous logic would have returned the list
  of files with the cacheDir path prefixed with them. While the remaining
  logic require the list of files in cacheDir, but without the cacheDir
  path prefix.

* use the new do_diff, by passing the list of files found in cacheDir to it
  as well as asking it to compare between the copyDir and the cacheDir.

* similarly only commit the diff of the tracked files in cacheDir to diffDir
  as well as inturn copy to the copyDir from cacheDir.

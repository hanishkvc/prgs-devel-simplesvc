Optimise commit logic

the _commit_filediff helper logic updated to

* remove the diff file corresponding to tracked files
  if they are empty (i.e no difference between working
  directory version and the last commited version in
  the copy directory).

  This helps avoid cluttering the diff folder with empty
  diff files for unchanged files (wrt each given commit)

* return true if the file is changed between copy and
  working directories.

avoid copying unchanged file again into copy directory
from the working directory

Added explanation for the _commit_filediff

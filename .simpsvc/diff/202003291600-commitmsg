usage info, peek_nextarg

Added more informative usage info, if nothing is specified
to ssvc when called.

Added a peek_nextarg logic, which checks if there is a arg
beyond the current arg, as requested to it, and inturn 
returns that argument. If such a arg doesnt exist, then it
returns None.

In turn use this peek logic when checking for arguments
to commands in process_args. Currently used for log command.

Without this, the previous code would have raised 
a exception, when trying the log command.

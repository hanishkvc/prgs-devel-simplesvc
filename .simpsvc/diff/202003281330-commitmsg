Make diff interactive and informative

Now one can make diff optionally interactive. i.e after each
file has been diffed, it will ask user to press any key to
continue.

Also now the do_diff logic will return info as to whether any
of the file diff'd had any difference or not.

NOTE: Later It will be used to decide, if one should go ahead
with the commit logic or not.

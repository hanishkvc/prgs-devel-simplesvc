Improve do_diff logic

Processing of arguments related to diff command moved into a new function
called diff_args.

It takes care of raw arguments like --CA-WD, --LC-CA, --LC-WD, as well as
user friendly arguments like --cached, --commit.

The default mode if no argument passed along with diff command is that of
--CA-WD i.e diff between the cached Dir and working Dir. Bcas the changes
already in cacheDir would have been previously cross checked wrt the last
commit version, when the file was added to cacheDir. So one is potentially
mainly interested in cross checking variations between what was previously
cached and the changed done beyond it in the working directory.

The program usage message has been updated wrt the diff command arguments

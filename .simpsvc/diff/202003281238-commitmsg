Commit updates file copy, copy helpers updated

Now when one does a commit, the files are copied
into the simple cvs's copyDir.

TO help with above, the copy related logics have
been refactored.

* previous sgcopy_cp has been renamed to _cp

* New sgcopy_cp takes the simpcvs me context,
  as well as the file to copy. It no longer
  requires the destination path to be specified.

  The logic will automatically determines the
  destination path in copyDir, from the given
  file to copy.

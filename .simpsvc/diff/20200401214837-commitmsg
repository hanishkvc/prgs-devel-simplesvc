Do_Diff If no files in cacheDir, then switch to testing against copyDir

do_diff by default, if no argument is given, will look at checking for
any changes between cached/staged version of the tracked files and the
same in the working directory.

However if there are no files already staged for commit, then switch
to testing for changes if any between the last commit and the working
directory.

TODO: Currently if there are no files in cacheDir, only then it will
fallback to checksing wrt copyDir. However I have to think, I may
have to do a more intelligent logic, where in the default mode, I
check working directory against cacheDir for files already staged in
cacheDir and against copyDir for files which were previously not 
staged in cacheDir.

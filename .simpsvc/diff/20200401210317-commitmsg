ssvc_fileexists_list, intelligent diff btw cacheDir and working dir

Added a ssvc_fileexists_list function, which uses the python filter
function to implement its logic. This is done to make it bit more
efficient. This function checks if the given list of files exist
in the specified base dir, and if it exists it is returned as part
of the list of files returned.

Inturn the above function is used to filter the file list in do_diff,
if the old files directory is specified as cacheDir. This ensures
that do_diff generates diffs only for the files which have been added
to the cacheDir (using add command), when cacheDir is the old-files
folder.

_commit_fileexists_list updated to use the new ssvc_fileexists_list

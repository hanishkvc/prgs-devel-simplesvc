New Add logic, so as to commit only specified files - P1

Added a cacheDir, which will contain files which are added
for the next commit.

Init command updated to create the cacheDir.

ssvccopy_mkdir and ssvccopy_cp changed to ssvc_mkdir & ssvc_cp.
Previously they always assumed copyDir as the destination. Now
they take a argument which tells which is the destination.

do_add updated to only copy specified files into cacheDir, in
addition to adding it to the tracked file list. It will no
longer try to commit the file. Instead one is required to
explicitly call commit command to achieve the previous behavior.

This also means that one is no longer required to generate a
commit message for the ADD operation.

TODO: By modifying do_commit to work with either files in 
working directory or cache directory, one can either commit
all changed files or only those changed files, which the user
has asked to be commited by using add after the last commit.

Thus one can control what and tracked files are commited during
any given commit operation.

TODO: May need to modify ssvc_cp further to take a BaseSrcPath
also in addition to the current BaseDestPath. Also may have to
add a recursive ssvc_removedir logic.

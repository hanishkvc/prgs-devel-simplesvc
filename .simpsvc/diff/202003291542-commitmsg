Optionally print associated diffs as part of log

Added --patch optional argument to log command. If one specifies
this argument, then along with printing the commit messages, it
also prints the associated diffs/... of each commit.

TODO: Currently the associated diffs/... of each commit is printed
first, before printing the corresponding commit message. Will have
to change the logic later OR else rename the files in diffDir such
that there is a sorting numeral after the timestamp prefix.

i.e for example TS-00-file_diff and TS-99-commit_msg

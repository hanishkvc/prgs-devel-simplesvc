_commit_op helper function

Certain ops require to be tracked by storing info about
them in the diffDir of the ssvc repository, as a commit
message file.

Previously a basic logic was added to achieve the same
directly in the do_add logic. Now it has been moved into
a generic logic called _commit_op.

It takes the name of the operation that requries to be
tracked and also the message to write to the commit msg
file.

NOTE:CHANGENOTICE: Previous commit message files in
diffDir, only had OP in the middle of their name. Now
instead they have OP_<THEOPERATION> in the middle of
their name.

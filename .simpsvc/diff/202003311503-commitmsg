unidirectional-new-file, generate diff file while adding file

Pass --unidirectional-new-file to diff commands used as part of
do_diff and do_commit. This ensures that if we dont have a 
given file in copyDir, then instead of giving a error, it will
generate a diff file corresponding to the full file content.

This all ensures that the same logic that was used in do_commit,
can be used from do_add also.

Now do_add also creates a diff file for the new file which was
added using above logic.

Also fixed a mistake in the documentation of _commit_filediff

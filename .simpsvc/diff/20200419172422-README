 ============
 
-TODO1: Commit only select files
+TODOs
+----------
+
+TODO01: do_diff fallback to checking working dir file against
+copyDir version of the file, in case cacheDir doesnt have the
+corresponding file (but has other files in it, due to which 
+autofall back to copyDir at the global level wont trigger).
+
+TODO02: Implement commit -a, that is bring back the old
+behavior for the cases, where one wants to commit all the
+files which have changed in the working dir, without having
+to first go thro the staging area in cacheDir, by calling
+add for each file individually. Useful if too many files
+have been changed.
+
+TODO03: diff a specific file
+
+TODO4: Remove the press key prompt when auto falling back
+to copyDir based diff check, when cacheDir is empty.
+
+
+Done
+--------
+
+Done01: Commit only select files

 This also gives more freedom to user to decide when to commit
 what, rather than forcing everything to be commited at the
 same time.

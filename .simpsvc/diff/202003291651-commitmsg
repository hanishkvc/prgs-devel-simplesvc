Attempt at sorting diffDir files for log printing

This is too simple a logic, which doesnt work fully.
It pushes commitmsg file to top of list, but files
which were commited as part of the same commit,
but which follow the commitmsg in default sort
order will get sorted by this new logic in the
wrong order.

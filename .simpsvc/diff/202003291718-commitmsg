Sort diffDir filelist based on timestamp

The sort_diffDir has been updated to use timestamp prefix
in the filename to decide whether it has seen all files 
belonging to a given commit and inturn sort them such that 
commitmsg file is first and then the remaining files of 
that commit follow it.

This fixes the issue with the previous simpler sort logic.

TODO: Have to implement the dprint print logic

Added log logic

It prints the contents of all the commit msgs till date.

It prints the commit messages from latest to oldest.

By default it just cats the commit msgs. However one
can set the option bLess argument to True, so that it
uses less to print the contents, so that people can go
throu the commit messages one at a time.

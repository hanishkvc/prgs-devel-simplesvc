Pass TS to _commit_op, instead of it generating

In do_add, I not only require to create a OP commitmsg but also
create the full diff file for the new file being added.

Previously _commit_op was creating its own timestamp, but that
can lead to wrong time stamps for two related timestamped files
in the diffDir (i.e the add-commitmsg and diff-of-new_file).

So now _commit_op no longer creates its own ts, instead one
requires to the pass the same. So now both do_add and do_init
generate the timestamp initially and then pass it to all required
helper functions.

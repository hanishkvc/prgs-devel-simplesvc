cat dont print newline, pass cmdline arg to do_diff

Now one can pass either --LC-CA or --LC-WD or --CA-WD

TODO: have to fix --CA-WD, bcas the current logic, shows
all the content of full file, for the files missing in
cacheDir. Note that cacheDir will only have some files
so one has to diff for only the files in cacheDir and
not for all files

SPECIAL OP, MANUAL RENAME OF the main File

MV hkvc-simple-cvs.py
TO hkvc-simple-svc.py

This involved:

move/rename the file in the working folder
rename the file entry in the srcs file.
rename the file in the copy folder.
create this special op commit message.

Obviously there is no automatic mapping of this file across
this manual move operation, by the logic.

However to help with future auto mapping or intelligent
linking of files across their rename / mv operation, I have
created that MV and TO entries at the top, as two independent
lines, so that if the filename has space (in future, haven't
tested now, so no idea, I have to think if I can have such
files now, less likely as I am not protecting the file names
within string delimiters, if I remember correctly).
